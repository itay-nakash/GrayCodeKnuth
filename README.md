# BalancedCodesKnuth

This project is an implementation of Knuth's algorithm for balanced codes, given in "Efficient Balanced Codes", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 32,
no. 1, pp. 51â€“53, Jan. 1986. 

Our implementation supports various input lengths and alphabet size of upto 10 symbols.
We also added some improvements for the algorithm, making it better for various cases.

A documented details can be seen in *description.pdf* file.
